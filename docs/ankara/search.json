    "text": "Methodology\nIn collaboration with Who Targets Me, we monitored 6254 political advertisers to better understand how campaigns use different targeting methods made available by Meta. To do this, we used data from the Meta Ad Library, using the new â€˜Audienceâ€™ data which gives some detail on how pages target their ads.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nMeta only provides 7, 30 and 90 days windows for the targeting data in their Ad Library. Metaâ€™s data also lags by a few days. Report will be updated as soon as new data is available.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer\n\n\n\nThe data shown in this dashboard is based on the platformâ€™s respective ad libraries which are known to be sometimes incomplete (Edelson et al.Â 2020; Silva et al.Â 2020). For this reason the data shown here might not reflect the full picture nor all political ads that were targeted at voters.\n\n\n\n\nAbout the Creators of the Dashboard\n\nOnurcan GÃ¼denFabio Votta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnurcan GÃ¼den is a PhD candidate in Media and Communication Studies at the Galatasaray University and a visiting researcher at the University of Amsterdam. His research focuses on the impact of computational propaganda in shaping digital political agendas in different democracies and its societal consequences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFabio Votta is a Postdoc at the University of Amsterdam who studies (online) political microtargeting and its usage around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWant to see how political parties target you?
